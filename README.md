# employee-database

This file uses a node application to automate the control of a database

## design

I chose a functional design instead of a modular design because i was the only person working on this app, and because there is no front end, there is no issues of data security

## next steps

two notable bugs are repeating entries to the temporary variable representing the database, and inquirer overwriting the end of previous console.table sections
